bun run dev
```

4. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

1. **Upload SVG**: Drag and drop an SVG file onto the upload area or click "Choose File"
2. **View 3D Model**: Your SVG will be automatically converted to a 3D extruded model
3. **Adjust Settings**: Use the settings panel to modify:
   - Extrusion depth and bevel properties
   - Material color, metalness, and roughness
   - Emissive properties for glow effects
4. **Export Component**: Click "Export React Component" to generate reusable code
5. **Download**: Copy the code to clipboard or download as a file
